# 100 Days of Data Science ðŸš€
Welcome to my 100 Days of Data Science adventure! This repository will document my daily learning and project-building journey as I dive into the essential tools, techniques, and insights of data science. Expect a mix of code snippets, insightful notes, and mini-projects across various topics, including Python, SQL, Excel, BI tools, and machine learning!

# Structure
- Weeks 1-4: Python fundamentals, data manipulation techniques, and foundational data science concepts.
- Weeks 5-8: SQL mastery, data visualization with Excel and Power BI, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Weeks 9-12: Key machine learning concepts with hands-on projects.
- Weeks 13-16: Advanced topics, including deep learning, NLP, and deployment strategies.
